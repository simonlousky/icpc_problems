The hardest question for me, I missed the class about fenwick tree and crushed my head 
around tens of tries with time limit exceeded.
With the fenwick tree I just count the number of -1's and 0's between I and J.
If the sum of 0's is not zero then the product is 0
If the sum of -1's is odd the product is negative
if both don't apply then the product is positive.
In fenwick tree add is logN, and sum is logN. 
for every action 'C' or 'P' we do logN so,
overall per case K*logN
