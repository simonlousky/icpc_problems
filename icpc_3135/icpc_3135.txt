I get every registration in a vii. 
when the input is finished i generate K entries for every registration.
each entry is a pair of the ID and the time it shoul pop.
e.g: (2004, 200), (2004, 400), ... (2004, k*200)
I put the K*N pairs in a vector and sort it by time then by Q_num
I output the K first entries.
Complexity is (N*K)log(N*K) because we sort our Queue vector
