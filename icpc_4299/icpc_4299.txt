1. The first stage is to build the graph of reachablity between every couple.
This stage is accomplished with a simple graph (vvi) where we connect each vertice i to vertice j
whene we gen that the input i,j is Y. 
Because the problem states that the couple will always choose the best option for travel, 
we calculate the min distance from a to b in the graph.
Since we may need this for a large number of couples, we build the distance lookup table with floyd-warshall.
2. The second stage is count the number of possible price distributions for a couple with budget m,
then divide this number by the total number of possible distributions.
Calculating the number of possible price distributions:

given R = 4
                      length 
                      of 
                      travel
added up money paided        | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | ... | 1000
                           1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | ... | 0
                           2 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | ... | 0
                           3 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 6 | 10| ... | 0
                           4 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 4 | 10| ... | 0

We look at the following recursive formula:
Number price distributions with path of length d, and added up paid price j
N(i, j) = N(i-1, j-1) + N(i-1, j-2) + ... + N(i-1, j-R)
In the solution we calculate the generic table of possiblities since it is the same base for every couple.

To get the result for a specific d, m we sum up the d'th row and divide by R^d

This technique worked on most tests, but eventually since we got wrong answers again and again,
we tried summing up the probabilities directly instead of counting and then calculate the probability,
and this did the trick.
