I find the convex hull that contains every q in S. 
If s exists then q_0 in hull has an oposite vertice q_n in hull.
I can then find a tentative s.
I iterate over every point q in S, check using a closed formula if the x,y at the opposite side of s exists in S.
If at some point the oposite vertice is not in S then I reject.
special case: If the size of the hull is odd, no solution exists.
complexity: SlogS the time to calculate convex hull. Then S^2 to check every opposite point.
overall S^2 which passes the test.
